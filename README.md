#  Autocomplete Map Author (WIP)

enables everyone to create autocomplete maps Ã  la "Why is [] so ..."

![latest screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Basic Concept

1. user uploads GeoJSON file with Geometries and Properties
   => GeoJSON is displayed on the map
2. user defines the phrase which has to gets autocompleted as "Why is ${name} so ..."
   => Googles Suggestion API is getting requested for every Feature
   => Geometries are filled with labels

## Things To Clarify

1. AngularJS vs. EmberJS vs. Plain JS vs. Apache Wicket vs...<br /> 
   => Bootstrap, RiotJS, ReduxJS
2. easy peasy D3 vs. MapboxGL<br />
   -> plain D3 offers more freedom in map projections<br />
   -> plain D3 offers more freedom in label placement<br />
   -> D3 SVG overlay over MapboxGL?<br />
   => D3 for first solution!
3. Suggestion on front-end or back-end side?<br />
   => first solution front-end only!
4. Where to upload the files?<br />
   -> Dropbox / S3 / maybe on Heroku<br />
   => GeoJSON textfield for first solution!
5. Application hosting on Heroku?<br />
   => why not?<br />
   => Heroku!
